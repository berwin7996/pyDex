When opening a file, it's preferable to use   open()  instead of invoking the  file  constructor directly.    The first two arguments are the same as for  stdio's  fopen() :   name  is the file name to be opened, and  mode  is a string indicating how  the file is to be opened.    The most commonly-used values of  mode  are  'r'  for reading,  'w'  for  writing (truncating the file if it already exists), and  'a'  for appending  (which on  some  Unix systems means that  all  writes append to the end of the  file regardless of the current seek position).  If  mode  is omitted, it  defaults to  'r' .  The default is to use text mode, which may convert   '\  '  characters to a platform-specific representation on writing and back  on reading.  Thus, when opening a binary file, you should append  'b'  to  the  mode  value to open the file in binary mode, which will improve  portability.  (Appending  'b'  is useful even on systems that don't treat  binary and text files differently, where it serves as documentation.)  See below  for more possible values of  mode .    The optional  buffering  argument specifies the file's desired buffer size: 0  means unbuffered, 1 means line buffered, any other positive value means use a  buffer of (approximately) that size (in bytes).  A negative  buffering  means  to use the system default, which is usually line buffered for tty devices and  fully buffered for other files.  If omitted, the system default is used.  [2]    Modes  'r+' ,  'w+'  and  'a+'  open the file for updating (reading and writing);  note that  'w+'  truncates the file.  Append  'b'  to the mode to open the file in  binary mode, on systems that differentiate between binary and text files; on  systems that don't have this distinction, adding the  'b'  has no effect.    In addition to the standard  fopen()  values  mode  may be  'U'  or   'rU' .  Python is usually built with  universal newlines  support;  supplying  'U'  opens the file as a text file, but lines may be terminated  by any of the following: the Unix end-of-line convention  '\  ' ,  the  Macintosh convention  '\\r' , or the Windows convention  '\\r\  ' . All of  these external representations are seen as  '\  '  by the Python program.  If Python is built without universal newlines support a  mode  with  'U'   is the same as normal text mode.  Note that file objects so opened also have  an attribute called  newlines  which has a value of  None  (if no  newlines have yet been seen),  '\  ' ,  '\\r' ,  '\\r\  ' , or a tuple  containing all the newline types seen.    Python enforces that the mode, after stripping  'U' , begins with  'r' ,   'w'  or  'a' .

And  doc  creates a docstring for the attribute.    A typical use is to define a managed attribute  x :    class   C ( object ):        def   __init__ ( self ):            self . _x   =   None          def   getx ( self ):            return   self . _x          def   setx ( self ,   value ):            self . _x   =   value          def   delx ( self ):            del   self . _x          x   =   property ( getx ,   setx ,   delx ,   \"I'm the 'x' property.\" )          If  c  is an instance of  C ,  c.x  will invoke the getter,   c.x   =   value  will invoke the setter and  del   c.x  the deleter.    If given,  doc  will be the docstring of the property attribute. Otherwise, the  property will copy  fget's docstring (if it exists).  This makes it possible to  create read-only properties easily using  property()  as a  decorator :    class   Parrot ( object ):        def   __init__ ( self ):            self . _voltage   =   100000          @property        def   voltage ( self ):            \"\"\"Get the current voltage.\"\"\"            return   self . _voltage          The  @property  decorator turns the  voltage()  method into a \"getter\"  for a read-only attribute with the same name, and it sets the docstring for   voltage  to \"Get the current voltage.\"    A property object has  getter ,  setter ,  and  deleter  methods usable as decorators that create a  copy of the property with the corresponding accessor function set to the  decorated function.  This is best explained with an example:    class   C ( object ):        def   __init__ ( self ):            self . _x   =   None          @property        def   x ( self ):            \"\"\"I'm the 'x' property.\"\"\"            return   self . _x          @x.setter        def   x ( self ,   value ):            self . _x   =   value          @x.deleter        def   x ( self ):            del   self . _x          This code is exactly equivalent to the first example.

This is useful if you have  edited the module source file using an external editor and want to try out the  new version without leaving the Python interpreter.  The return value is the  module object (the same as the  module  argument).    When  reload(module)  is executed:    Python modules' code is recompiled and the module-level code reexecuted,  defining a new set of objects which are bound to names in the module's  dictionary.  The  init  function of extension modules is not called a second  time.    As with all other objects in Python the old objects are only reclaimed after  their reference counts drop to zero.    The names in the module namespace are updated to point to any new or changed  objects.    Other references to the old objects (such as names external to the module) are  not rebound to refer to the new objects and must be updated in each namespace  where they occur if that is desired.    There are a number of other caveats:    If a module is syntactically correct but its initialization fails, the first   import  statement for it does not bind its name locally, but does  store a (partially initialized) module object in  sys.modules .  To reload the  module you must first  import  it again (this will bind the name to the  partially initialized module object) before you can  reload()  it.    When a module is reloaded, its dictionary (containing the module's global  variables) is retained.  Redefinitions of names will override the old  definitions, so this is generally not a problem.  If the new version of a module  does not define a name that was defined by the old version, the old definition  remains.  This feature can be used to the module's advantage if it maintains a  global table or cache of objects -- with a  try  statement it can test  for the table's presence and skip its initialization if desired:    try :        cache    except   NameError :        cache   =   {}          It is legal though generally not very useful to reload built-in or dynamically  loaded modules, except for  sys ,  __main__  and  __builtin__ .  In many cases, however, extension modules are not designed to be initialized  more than once, and may fail in arbitrary ways when reloaded.    If a module imports objects from another module using  from  ...   import  ..., calling  reload()  for the other module does not  redefine the objects imported from it -- one way around this is to re-execute  the  from  statement, another is to use  import  and qualified  names ( module .*name*) instead.    If a module instantiates instances of a class, reloading the module that defines  the class does not affect the method definitions of the instances -- they  continue to use the old class definition.  The same is true for derived classes.   "]},

If  the second argument is an object,  isinstance(obj,   type)  must be true.  If  the second argument is a type,  issubclass(type2,   type)  must be true (this  is useful for classmethods).       Note    super()  only works for  new-style class es.       There are two typical use cases for  super .  In a class hierarchy with  single inheritance,  super  can be used to refer to parent classes without  naming them explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable.  This use  closely parallels the use of  super  in other programming languages.    The second use case is to support cooperative multiple inheritance in a  dynamic execution environment.  This use case is unique to Python and is  not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support  single inheritance.  This makes it possible to implement \"diamond diagrams\"  where multiple base classes implement the same method.  Good design dictates  that this method have the same calling signature in every case (because the  order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts  to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include  sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime).    For both use cases, a typical superclass call looks like this:    class   C ( B ):        def   method ( self ,   arg ):            super ( C ,   self ) . method ( arg )          Note that  super()  is implemented as part of the binding process for  explicit dotted attribute lookups such as  super().__getitem__(name) .  It does so by implementing its own  __getattribute__()  method for searching  classes in a predictable order that supports cooperative multiple inheritance.  Accordingly,  super()  is undefined for implicit lookups using statements or  operators such as  super()[name] .    Also note that  super()  is not limited to use inside methods.  The two  argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate  references.    For practical suggestions on how to design cooperative classes using   super() , see  guide to using super() .       New in version 2.2.      "]},

The  encoding  parameter is a string giving the name of an encoding;  if the encoding is not known,  LookupError  is raised. Error handling is  done according to  errors ; this specifies the treatment of characters which are  invalid in the input encoding.  If  errors  is  'strict'  (the default), a   ValueError  is raised on errors, while a value of  'ignore'  causes  errors to be silently ignored, and a value of  'replace'  causes the official  Unicode replacement character,  U+FFFD , to be used to replace input  characters which cannot be decoded.  See also the  codecs  module.    If no optional parameters are given,  unicode()  will mimic the behaviour of   str()  except that it returns Unicode strings instead of 8-bit strings. More  precisely, if  object  is a Unicode string or subclass it will return that  Unicode string without any additional decoding applied.    For objects which provide a  __unicode__()  method, it will call this method  without arguments to create a Unicode string. For all other objects, the 8-bit  string version or representation is requested and then converted to a Unicode  string using the codec for the default encoding in  'strict'  mode.

{"name": ["__import__"], "description": ["   Note    This is an advanced function that is not needed in everyday Python  programming, unlike  importlib.import_module() .       This function is invoked by the  import  statement.  It can be  replaced (by importing the  __builtin__  module and assigning to   __builtin__.__import__ ) in order to change semantics of the   import  statement, but nowadays it is usually simpler to use import  hooks (see  PEP 302 ).  Direct use of  __import__()  is rare, except in  cases where you want to import a module whose name is only known at runtime.    The function imports the module  name , potentially using the given  globals   and  locals  to determine how to interpret the name in a package context.  The  fromlist  gives the names of objects or submodules that should be  imported from the module given by  name .  The standard implementation does  not use its  locals  argument at all, and uses its  globals  only to  determine the package context of the  import  statement.    level  specifies whether to use absolute or relative imports.  The default  is  -1  which indicates both absolute and relative imports will be  attempted.   0  means only perform absolute imports.  Positive values for   level  indicate the number of parent directories to search relative to the  directory of the module calling  __import__() .    When the  name  variable is of the form  package.module , normally, the  top-level package (the name up till the first dot) is returned,  not  the  module named by  name .  However, when a non-empty  fromlist  argument is  given, the module named by  name  is returned.    For example, the statement  import   spam  results in bytecode resembling the  following code:    spam   =   __import__ ( 'spam' ,   globals (),   locals (),   [],   - 1 )          The statement  import   spam.ham  results in this call:    spam   =   __import__ ( 'spam.ham' ,   globals (),   locals (),   [],   - 1 )          Note how  __import__()  returns the toplevel module here because this is  the object that is bound to a name by the  import  statement.    On the other hand, the statement  from   spam.ham   import   eggs,   sausage   as    saus  results in    _temp   =   __import__ ( 'spam.ham' ,   globals (),   locals (),   [ 'eggs' ,   'sausage' ],   - 1 )    eggs   =   _temp . eggs    saus   =   _temp . sausage          Here, the  spam.ham  module is returned from  __import__() .  From this  object, the names to import are retrieved and assigned to their respective  names.    If you simply want to import a module (potentially within a package) by name,  use  importlib.import_module() .       Changed in version 2.5:  The level parameter was added.
